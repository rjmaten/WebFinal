  <h1>Reflection - Ryan Maten</h1>
  <p>
  <div class="tab">Overall, developing this website was fairly straightforward and I only had one or two major hangups. The very first problem I had, and arguably my biggest one, was figuring out what to make a website about. Nothing really immediately popped out for me, so I ended up asking my sister and this is what we came up with. I feel like because it wasn’t really my idea, that I never really fell in love with the project and I found it hard to motivate myself to do improve the site. So if there was one thing I could do different it would be to have put more effort into creating a project that I actually cared about, because that would’ve made this entire class totally different for me.

  <div class="tab">Another problem that I had was this bug that took me forever to figure out, “The Case of the Ghost Menu-Button”. Basically I forgot to close out an <a> tag right above the navigation menu, and the CSS turned it into an extra menu button on top. Didn’t really hurt anything, it just looked really annoying. That was also the reason why my HTML files would never validate properly, the validators would get hung up on the error. Fixing all of that by just adding “</a>” felt pretty good. My last problem was figuring out how to link my stylesheet to my index.html in GitHub Pages. Essentially I just thought was too hard about it, and used the file’s raw link (similar to how I linked the photos) which obviously did not work. So when I Googled how to fix my issues and no one else on the internet seemed to have had a similar problem, I realized that it must have been a dumb question. It was, it’s literally just stylesheet.css. At least I figured that one out pretty quickly.
