  <h1>Fashion Blog Project</h1>

  <h3>Project Summary & Objectives</h3>

  <p>As I'm sure you've deduced from the main heading, this is going to be a
    fashion blog. I was unsure of what I should make a website about, and my
    sister has been considering starting her own fashion blog so I figured that
    making her a little website would be a great way fro her to get started. The
    main objective of this site is going to be to display media such as photos
    and videos in a visually appealing. There will be very little in the form of
    text-based content and will mainly revolve around CSS and the presentation
    side.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Content & Initial Design Ideas</h3>

  <p>The main audience of the website is going to be younger adults, or
    individuals interested in modern fashion (specifically streetware). because
    of the fashion focus most of the content on the site is just going to be
    pictures, with the occassional text-based blog post. My initial desgin idea
    is to seperate different albums or "looks" into different pages in the
    website, then using css to portray the photos in a visually appealling way
    that is easily viewable for the page visitors. I was specifically thinking
    of using a css effect called parallax (at least that's what YouTube calls it)
    to display the photos.

  <h3>HTML Structure & CSS Presentation</h3>

  <p>HTML is going to be used to define the structure of my webpage.Using
  I will be able to decribe the structure of my pages. Such as describing any
  headings, text, photos, hypertext links, videos, and much more that will
  appear in the page. With the elements of HTML labeling pieces of content such
  as "paragraph", or "table". CSS is the language for descriving the presentation
  of my webpage. CSS is independent of HTML and allows for the presentation to
  be adapted to different devices or environments.</p>

  <h3>Proper Semantic Structure</h3>

  <p>When developing a website, it is very important to use proper semantic
    structure and Web standards. Writing semantically correct markup means
    understanding the hierarchy of your content, as well as how both users and
    machines are going to read it. There are three main reasons why this is
    important: SEO, accessibility, and maintenance. SEO, or "search engine
    optimization", is important because it allows search engines to effectivly
    determine what your website is about and why your content is relevent. When
    developing a website, accessibility of said site typically isn't near the
    top of your priority list. However, it should be. Using semantic HTML makes
    it easier for people and machines to read and understand it. In turn making
    it easier for a wider audience with varying browsers and search engines to
    access your site, as well as people with disabilities. Using semantic markup
    also results in very clear, standardized code, which can be easily maintained
    by any developer.
